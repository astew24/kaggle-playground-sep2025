echo "# Kaggle Playground Series S3E9 - Concrete Strength Prediction

## Project Overview
This project implements a machine learning pipeline to predict concrete compressive strength based on various material properties and mix ratios.

## Files
- \`playground_model.ipynb\` - Main Jupyter notebook with EDA and modeling
- \`data/\` - Dataset files (not tracked in git due to size)
- \`submission.csv\` - Generated predictions for Kaggle submission

## Setup
1. Install required packages: \`pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn jupyter\`
2. Download competition data to \`data/\` folder
3. Run the notebook: \`jupyter notebook playground_model.ipynb\`

## Progress
- [x] Data loading and inspection
- [x] Exploratory data analysis
- [x] Baseline Random Forest model
- [x] Test predictions and submission
- [ ] Feature engineering
- [ ] Model optimization
- [ ] Advanced modeling techniques

## Next Steps
- Fix column name issues
- Implement feature engineering
- Try different algorithms (XGBoost, LightGBM)
- Hyperparameter tuning
- Ensemble methods" > README.md
